I understand the unitary fund wishes for a video, and I'd like to provide an explanation for the lack of rather than one. I'm incredibly fidgety mentally, I'm in the middle of picking myself up from homelessness and part of that includes taking care of my mental state. I cannot yet take care of the attention issues that plague my life though not so much my projects. Doing my research has actually healed me a lot to have targets, maintain the rigor necessary to produce a nature or physical review level paper. It is much easier for me to explain using text that it is for me to try and make a video for you that genuinely would not capture my drive, intent or thought processes, and without being able to reflect off my own words I'm afraid the project would be greatly undersold. This isn't about a stage performance this is about science.
I will elaborate further where I was cut off in the first brief explanation. Hardware time is necessary to validate the noise research strategically, there's ~30+ experiments there alone that need checked. I have used absolutely all available free resources, and have hit a wall in this regard. Hopefully a small partnership would allow for this work to be verified and validated, and for some technology partnerships or startups to come from it. The numbers Claude throws around certainly seem enticing even when adjusted for potential exaggeration
